            I&apos;m a software developer based in Enugu, Nigeria. Everyday,
            I&apos;m trying to learn new technologies while trying to find time
            to master the ones I already know. Trying so hard to quit
            multitaksing (I know it is unproductive) but we are getting there.
            I&apos;m very easygoing and cool to hang out with (I believe in
            teamwork). <br />
            <br /> I have been a part of this industry (tech) for over two years
            (almost three years ðŸ˜‰) and within that time I&apos;ve been able to
            not only gather knowledge but master various languages, tools,
            whatever. I believe strongly in my frontend skills (don&apos;t mind
            the boring website, had to make something quick, mature and easy in
            a short time ðŸ¥²). Oh yeah, don&apos;t mistake me for a boy please ðŸ˜‚
            I&apos;m a girl with different tastes ðŸ™ƒ. <br />
            <br />
            Even though my encounter with tech was by luck (a very lucky luck
            ðŸ˜‚), I&apos;ve come to fall in love with using codes to build out
            software. More especially, I love the power programming gives to me.
            I don&apos;t have good ideas but I&apos;d love to collaborate with
            you on yours. <br /> When I&apos;m not writing code, I&apos;m
            probably on MKBHD&apos;s channel on youtube (that guy knows his
            stuff!), watching movies on Netflix, looking for a new novel to read
            on Wattpad, or grinding up on Mathematics ðŸ™ƒ I&apos;m open to
            collaborations and part-time roles only (I&apos;m still in school
            ðŸ¥²)
